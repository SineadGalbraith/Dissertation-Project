  <b>A Collaborative Game-Based Approach for Children’s Learning of Computer Programming.</b>
</p>

This dissertation project aimed to explore the use and benefits of collaborative game-based activities in children's learning of computer programming. 

This project was motivated by personal experience as a mentor with the Trinity CoderDojo branch. The CoderDojo organisation makes use of the Scratch programming platform to help children of all ages learn and understand basic programming concepts. While mentoring and observing how children interact and learn from the Scratch platform, it was clear that not all students engaged effectively with block-based platforms. This project particularly focused on presenting an alternative platform for those students.

The goal of this dissertation project was to develop a smartphone application that provides an alternative platform and method of learning for children to learn computer programming. The content provided within the application is Scratch-adjacent, allowing children aged 8-12 to learn the basic programming concepts in a different way.

The Research Question for this dissertation is:
<p align="center">
  <i>How can children’s learning of computer programming be aided by collaborative game-based activities?</i>
</p>

### Application Content Categories

Using the existing block-based platforms as a reference, 4 distinct categories were outlined for the content provided in the application: Variables, Arithmetic, Conditions and Looping. Research into all four areas has been carried out. The application scope includes Variables and Arithmetic.

### Technologies Used

- Kotlin
- Android Studio
- OpenGL ES
- Bluetooth
